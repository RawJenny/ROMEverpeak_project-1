Below are my key insights/observations  and recommendations:

 

OBSERVATIONS
The following was Observed;

 

1. The Top 5 Cities by Revenue shows the highest revenue-generating cities. New York leads with $67,180.50, significantly ahead of the next highest city, Portland, which generated $50,198.35. Miami follows closely at $50,145.33, while Memphis and Chicago contributed $43,703.00 and $41,095.01, respectively.  This visualization emphasizes how revenue is concentrated in a few major cities, with New York standing out as the dominant market.

 

2. The Sales Trends Report tracks revenue performance month by month in 2019. January started with $32,907.84, but revenue dropped significantly in February to $19,955.50, marking the year's lowest point. The numbers recovered slightly in March and April before peaking in June at $55,601.61. July saw another drop to $27,318.54 before revenue climbed again, with December hitting the highest point of the year at $66,642.78. This pattern indicates significant fluctuations, with mid-year and end-of-year peaks suggesting possible seasonal trends affecting sales performance.

 

3. The Transaction by Amount breaks down the number of transactions into different value ranges. The majority of transactions fall within the $0 - $1,000 range, with 218 transactions, indicating that most purchases are of relatively low value. The number decreases sharply for higher transaction values, with only 85 transactions between $1,000 and $2,000 and even fewer in higher ranges. Only a single transaction falls in the $7,000 - $8,000 bracket, showing that high-value sales are rare. The distribution suggests that the business operates primarily on a high-volume, low-value sales model.

 

4. The Top 6 Ship Cities visualizes the cities receiving the highest shipments by revenue. New York is the largest segment with $67,180.50, followed by Portland at $50,198.35 and Miami at $50,145.33. Memphis, Chicago, and Milwaukee also contribute, but with relatively lower amounts. The chart format helps compare shipment distribution among cities, with New York capturing the largest share. This aligns with the revenue trends seen earlier, reinforcing the idea that New York is a key market for both sales and shipping.

 

5. The Sales by Product Category presents revenue contributions from different product categories. Beverages dominate with $110,577.11, far exceeding the next highest category, Sauces, which brought in $69,000.00. Jams & Preserves contributed $51,541.00, while Dairy Products and Dried Fruits & Nuts made up smaller portions with $33,129.60 and $27,999.50, respectively. The clear revenue gap between Beverages and other categories highlights its importance as the leading product line.

6. The Performance Analysis by Salesperson ranks salespeople based on revenue generated. Nancy Freehafer is the highest performer with $104,242.34, well ahead of Anne Larsen, who secured $93,848.33. Andrew follows with $67,180.50, while the remaining salespeople contribute significantly lower sales figures, with Jan Kotas at the bottom with $16,350.50. The charts make it clear that sales performance is not evenly distributed, with a few top performers driving most of the revenue.

 

7. The Sales by Region compares revenue contributions from different regions. The Northern Region leads with $141,660.34, making it the most lucrative market. The West follows with $108,275.51, while the East and South regions generate $93,848.33 and $91,251.98, respectively. The chart visually highlights how the Northern Region outperforms the others, though the revenue distribution across regions is relatively balanced apart from the North’s advantage.

 

8. The Top 10 Customers lists the highest revenue-generating companies. Company D is the top contributor with $67,180.50, followed by Company H with $50,198.35. Other companies, such as Company BB ($43,703.00) and Company F ($37,418.00), contribute notable amounts but fall significantly behind the top two. The remaining customers bring in progressively lower revenue, with Company J and Company Z generating around $29,000 each. This visualization highlights the concentration of revenue among a few key customers.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are my recommendations:

 

1. I recommend, focusing on High-Revenue Cities: Since New York, Portland, and Miami generate the highest revenue, expanding marketing efforts, promotions, and supply chains in these cities could drive further growth. Efficient logistics and inventory management in these areas will help meet demand effectively.

 

2. Leverage December's Peak Sales: December had the highest sales, indicating strong seasonal demand. Running targeted holiday promotions, discounts, or bundled offers during this period can maximize revenue. Analyzing the factors behind December’s success can help replicate similar strategies in other months.

 

3. Prioritize Beverage Sales: Beverages lead in sales with $110,577.11, making them a high-priority product category. Increasing stock levels, negotiating better supplier deals, and introducing new beverage options could enhance profitability. Cross-selling beverages with related products like sauces and jams can maximize purchases.

 

4. Encourage Higher Transaction Values: Most transactions fall within the $0 - $1,000 range. Introducing loyalty programs, volume discounts, or premium product bundles can encourage customers to increase their order sizes. Promotional campaigns focusing on bulk purchases could also drive higher-value transactions.

 

5. Expand Sales Efforts in Other Regions: The Northern Region leads with $141,660.34, but the West, East, and South also show strong contributions. Targeting marketing efforts in underperforming regions and tailoring product offerings to regional preferences could boost sales.

 

6. Learn from Top Sales Performers: Nancy Freehafer and Anne Larsen significantly outperform others. Analyzing their sales strategies and introducing mentoring programs could improve the performance of other salespeople. Incentives or commission-based rewards can further motivate the sales team.

 

7. Strengthen Relationships with Top Customers: Company D and Company H contribute significant revenue. Building long-term relationships through personalized deals, exclusive offers, or priority service can ensure continued business. Identifying similar high-value customers and targeting them with strategic sales efforts can diversify revenue sources.

 

8. Optimize Shipping and Supply Chain for Key Locations: With New York as the top sales and shipping city, ensuring a robust supply chain and delivery infrastructure is essential. Faster shipping options, efficient warehouse management, and partnerships with local distributors can enhance customer satisfaction.

 

9. Address Sales Fluctuations Throughout the Year:  Sales trends show noticeable dips in February, July, and August. Investigating the reasons behind these declines can help develop counter-strategies, such as launching seasonal promotions, introducing new product lines, or adjusting pricing strategies during slow periods.
